## File Overview

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `SKILL.md` | Main skill file (compatible with both Hermes Agent and Claude Code) |
| `README.md` | This guide |

## 一、Install on Hermes Agent

### Method 1 — One-line install via URL (recommended)

```bash
hermes skills install https://raw.githubusercontent.com/antica1/head-neck-acc-rt-targets/master/SKILL.md
```

### Method 2 — Tap the GitHub repo as skill source

```bash
hermes skills tap add https://github.com/antica1/head-neck-acc-rt-targets
hermes skills install adenoid-cystic-carcinoma-rt-targets
```

### Method 3 — Manual copy

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.hermes/skills/research/adenoid-cystic-carcinoma-rt-targets
curl -o ~/.hermes/skills/research/adenoid-cystic-carcinoma-rt-targets/SKILL.md \

## 二、Search & Trigger Keywords

Once installed, the skill activates automatically when these terms appear in conversation:

| Language | Trigger Keywords |
|----------|-----------------|
| English | `adenoid cystic carcinoma`, `ACC target delineation`, `ACC radiotherapy`, `trigeminal nerve pathway`, `perineural invasion RT`, `cavernous sinus ACC` |
| Chinese | `腺样囊性癌`, `ACC 靶区`, `三叉神经通路`, `神经侵犯放疗`, `海绵窦照射` |

**Manual load**: `/skill adenoid-cystic-carcinoma-rt-targets`

## 三、Install on Claude Code (Claude Desktop)

Copy the `SKILL.md` into Claude Code's skills-plugin directory:

```bash
# Locate Claude's skills directory (varies by installation)
# Typical path on Windows:
cp SKILL.md %LOCALAPPDATA%/Claude-3p/local-agent-mode-sessions/skills-plugin/<user-uuid>/skills/adenoid-cystic-carcinoma-rt-targets/

# On macOS/Linux:
cp SKILL.md ~/.claude/skills/adenoid-cystic-carcinoma-rt-targets/
```

The same trigger keywords apply.
